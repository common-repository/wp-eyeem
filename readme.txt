With this Plugin you could connect your EyeEm account on your WordPress blog

== Description ==

With this plugin you can include your photos on EyeEm into your WordPress blog. At the moment this plugin is in development and this is a very first
alpha release, which still might have bugs an is missing functionality. At this time, my plugin will only show the 20 newest photos, as i worked on the
EyeEm php API wrapper without any special configuration. I plan to implement more features in the future. If you have an suggestions, don't hesitate to
contact me.
